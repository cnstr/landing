				<Text>
					Aerum LLC works with numerous projects (both open and closed source) to integrate the Canister service into them and enrich the experience for users. Aerum LLC strictly audits these integrations abide by the Privacy Policy. Official integrations are a trusted extension of the Canister service and require the user to agree to this Privacy Policy.
					Due to the open nature of the Canister service, third-party services may easily incorporate Canister into their systems. However, Aerum LLC does not audit these services, and these services may have separate data collection systems.
